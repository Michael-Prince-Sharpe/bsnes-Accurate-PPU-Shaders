# bsnes-Accurate-PPU-Shaders
CRT Royale and CRT Royale Kurozumi shaders for use with the accurate PPU only in bsnes. These also work on the Super Nintendo cores of ares and Higan. The accurate cores always output in the Super Nintendo's high resolution of 512x480 and these shaders fix the jittery interlacing that occurs in this mode. A big thanks to Hizzlekizzle for his help with creating this fix.
